Gait Based Authentication System
This project aims to authenticate people based on gait - the way of oneâ€™s walking,

we initially propose to collect data from android operated smartphone through

accelerometer in 3 axes and import the data to a statistical programming environment

and perform noise removal, modelling and matching operations there.

We aim to train a model and identify the subject upon evaluating the model

trained earlier and obtain the results.
